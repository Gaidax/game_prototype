You gave your soul to an ancient spirit and became 
a soulless undead wanderer in the woods. 
You became hollow. You can not sleep, you can not 
eat, you can not drink, you can not experience 
anything that a human can any longer. You are just 
an empty wessel of madness and hunger 
for souls. You soon loose your ability to think 
and all you care for is souls. 
You need them to become alive again. You want 
to take them from others, as much as you can. 
Too bad you don't know that this won't help you. 
Nothing will help you now.
