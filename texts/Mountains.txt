You see a man in a silly salamander costume. "Salamander Man" 
echoes in your head. You realise that this thing cannot be 
human despite of the way it looks. Very strange. 
He holds a flute near his nostrils and
starts to play a simple melody. Over time it 
becomes more sophisticated and you start to like it. 
It sounds just like your favourite song.
