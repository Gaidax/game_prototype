You see a man in a black costume. 
"Chin Chin" - echoes in your head- "I need sacrifices. You owe me one." 
Now it is obvious that despite his silly looks it might not be of your kind. 
This inhuman creature is clearly up to no good. Darknwss is oozing from him 
and covers all around you. It seems that it could be the end for you. 
This creature is a pure manifistation of evil.
