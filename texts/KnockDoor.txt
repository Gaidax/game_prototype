You see a pink man. This man is either insane or he is not a human. 
You sense that he is indeed not a human but an ancient being that dwells and 
guards these lands from times long past. It seems that there is nothing a mere human 
like yourself can interest him with.
Maybe you shouldn't bother him at all and leave while you still can.
