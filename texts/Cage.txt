It looks like it is not an ordinary man after all. 
And he was unable to understand a friendly gesture of yours. 
You soon realise that reality was shifted and you are now in a 
cage somewhere deep below the ground. He thought that you were 
offerening him your soul and your body as sacrifice to an insult. 
Somehow this thought appeared in your head. What could it be that 
insulted him? What will happen to you now? Who knows. 
But you won't get home anytime soon.
