It seems that customs of these strange land is different from that of yours. 
Friendly gesture at home means an offering here. 
Pink man quickly approaches you, takes your hand and you 
suddenly realise that it's not on its proper place anymore. 
Your hand is gone. However, Pink lets you go but you feel that
something that needed to be done is not done. 
You keep thinking about that place even when you find yourself
at home again. Something bad was still in the air.
