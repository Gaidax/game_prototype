You defeated evil Chin Chin and these lands are safe again. 
But maybe he was back because humans disrespect nature? 
He tried to tell us that nature needs sacrifices? Or was he just an evil spirit? Who knows. 
Pink Man sure don't. He stood there for a moment and left 
without saying a word. What a strange fella. Anyhow, now everything is peacefull and dandy and that's 
all you need to know. Congrats to you!
